# Overview

This repository contains a Java application for secure file transfer. The project is organized as a standard Maven-style layout:

- `src/main/java` — primary Java source files.
- `src/main/resources` — resource files and manifest metadata.
- `src/test/java` — unit and integration tests.
- `target/` — Maven output directory.

Key source files present in the workspace:

- `Launcher.java` — alternative app launcher (top-level).
- `SecureFileTransfer.java` — core functionality (implements transfer logic).
- `org/example/Main.java` — package-namespaced main class.

This project assumes standard JVM tooling (Maven) for build and dependency management.
